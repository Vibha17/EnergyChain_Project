   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Python (3.9+):**
   Download and install from the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).
   Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   pip --version
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   - **Truffle Framework:** Install globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g truffle
     ```
   - **Python Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Install Ganache:**

## **How to Run**

### **Step 1: Deploy Smart Contracts**
1. Navigate to the project directory and compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```
2. Deploy the contracts to a local blockchain using Ganache:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```
3. Note the deployed contract addresses, which can be found in the Ganache "TRANSACTIONS" tab.

### **Step 2: Simulate IoT Data**
1. Move to the IoT directory:
   ```bash
   cd iot
   ```
2. Run the MQTT publisher script to simulate IoT energy data generation:
   ```bash
   python mqtt_energy_publisher.py
   ```

### **Step 3: Generate and Validate ZK-SNARK Proofs**
1. Navigate to the ZK-SNARK directory:
   ```bash
   cd zk_snarks
   ```
2. Run the proof generator and validator script:
   ```bash
   python zk_energy_proof.py
   ```

## **Integration Workflow**

### **1. IoT Integration**
IoT devices, represented by `mqtt_energy_publisher.py`, generate real-time energy data. This data is structured in JSON format and sent to the blockchain for further processing.

### **2. Privacy-Preserving Validation**
The `zk_energy_proof.py` script uses ZK-SNARKs to validate the energy data. These proofs ensure the integrity of the data while maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information.

### **3. Blockchain Transactions**
The deployed smart contracts facilitate core energy trading operations, such as creating trades and issuing payments. All transactions are transparently recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed in Ganache.

---

## **Live Demonstration Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify Smart Contract Deployment**
1. Open Ganache.
2. Check the "TRANSACTIONS" tab to ensure the contracts are deployed correctly.

### **Step 2: Simulate IoT Data**
1. Run `mqtt_energy_publisher.py` to simulate smart meter data being published.
2. Inspect Ganache logs for incoming transactions that reflect this data.

### **Step 3: Validate ZK-SNARK Proofs**
1. Execute `zk_energy_proof.py` to generate and verify ZK-SNARK proofs for the data.
2. Confirm successful validation through the script output.

### **Step 4: Review Transactions in Ganache**
1. Check the "CONTRACTS" tab in Ganache to verify interactions with the smart contracts (e.g., `createTrade` function calls).
